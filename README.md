# Audio Transcription Web App -

Welcome to the Audio Transcription Web App! This React application allows users to record audio, transcribe it using Deepgram's transcription service, and view past transcriptions. The app is built with React and Tailwind CSS, and it integrates with the Deepgram API for audio transcription.

## Features

- **Record Audio**: Start and stop recording audio directly from the web app.
- **Real-Time Transcription**: Transcribe recorded audio using Deepgram's transcription service.
- **View Transcriptions**: View a list of past transcriptions, with the ability to refresh the list.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling to ensure a responsive and modern design.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Deepgram API**: For audio transcription services.
- **Plyr**: A simple HTML5 media player for playing recorded audio.

## Future Enhancements

Currently, this project is focused on the frontend experience, using local storage to save past transcriptions. However, I've plan to add a backend in the future to:

- **Persist Data**: Store transcriptions, user data, and recordings in a database.
- **User Authentication**: Allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their transcriptions.
- **Enhanced Features**: Include features like saving transcriptions to the cloud, sharing, and more.
